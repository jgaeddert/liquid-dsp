liquid-dsp examples
===================

This directory contains all the examples for interfacing the liquid modules.

 * `agc_crcf_example.c`:
    Automatic gain control example demonstrating its transient response.

 * `agc_crcf_qpsk_example.c`:
    Automatic gain control test for data signals with fluctuating signal
    levels.  QPSK modulation introduces periodic random zero-crossings which
    gives instantaneous amplitude levels near zero.  This example tests the
    response of the AGC to these types of signals.

 * `ampmodem_example.c`:
    Tests simple modulation/demodulation of the ampmodem (analog amplitude
    modulator/demodulator) with noise, carrier phase, and carrier frequency
    offsets.

 * `asgramcf_example.c`:
    ASCII spectrogram example for complex inputs. This example demonstrates
    the functionality of the ASCII spectrogram. A sweeping complex sinusoid
    is generated and the resulting spectral periodogram is printed to the
    screen.

 * `asgramf_example.c`:
    ASCII spectrogram example for real-valued input. This example demonstrates
    the functionality of the ASCII spectrogram for real-valued input signals.
    A cosine signal with time-varying frequency is generated and the resulting
    spectral periodogram is printed to the screen. Because the time signal has
    no complex component, its spectrum is symmetric.

 * `autocorr_cccf_example.c`:
    This example demonstrates the autocorr (auto-correlation) object
    functionality.  A random time-domain sequence is generated which exhibits
    time-domain repetitions (auto-correlation properties), for example:
    abcdabcdabcd....abcd.  The sequence is pushed through the autocorr object,
    and the results are written to an output file. The command-line arguments
    allow the user to experiment with the sequence length, number of sequence
    repetitions, and properties of the auto-correlator, as well as signal-to-
    noise ratio.

 * `bpacketsync_example.c`:

 * `bpresync_example.c`:
    This example demonstrates the binary pre-demodulator synchronizer. A random
    binary sequence is generated, modulated with BPSK, and then interpolated.
    The resulting sequence is used to generate a bpresync object which in turn
    is used to detect a signal in the presence of carrier frequency and timing
    offsets and additive white Gauss noise.

 * `bsequence_example.c`:
    This example demonstrates the interface to the bsequence (binary sequence)
    object.  The bsequence object acts like a buffer of bits which are stored
    and manipulated efficiently in memory.

 * `bufferf_example.c`:

    Solve linear system of equations `Ax = b` using the conjugate-
    gradient method where A is a symmetric positive-definite matrix.
    Compare speed to matrixf_linsolve() for same system.

 * `chromosome_example.c`:

 * `compand_cf_example.c`:

 * `compand_example.c`:
    This example demonstrates the interface to the compand function
    (compression, expansion).  The compander is typically used with the
    quantizer to increase the dynamic range of the converter, particularly for
    low-level signals.  The transfer function is computed (empirically) and
    printed to the screen.

 * `complementary_codes_example.c`:
    This example demonstrates how to generate complementary binary codes
    in liquid.  A pair of codes is generated using the bsequence
    interface, their auto-correlations are computed, and the result is
    summed and printed to the screen.  The results are also printed to
    an output file, which plots the sequences and their
    auto-correlations.

              `msequence_example.c`

 * `cpfskmodem_example.c`:

 * `conversion_example.c`:
    
    This example demonstrates conversion from complex baseband to a real-valued
    signal, and then down-conversion back to complex baseband while removing the
    negative image.
    
     STEP 1: A signal is generated at complex baseband consisting of narrow-band
             filtered noise and an offset tone (to show asymmetry in the transmit
             spectrum).
    
     STEP 2: The signal is mixed up to a carrier 'fc' (relative to the sampling
             frequency) and the real-component of the result is retained. This is
             the DAC output. The spectrum of this signal has two images: one at
             +fc, the other at -fc.
    
     STEP 3: The DAC output is mixed back down to complex baseband and the lower
             image is (mostly) filtered off. Reminants of the lower frequency
             component are still visible due to the wide-band and low-order
             filter on the receiver. The received complex baseband signal also
             has a reduction in power by 2 because half the signal's energy (the
             negative image) is filtered off.
    
 * `crc_example.c`:
    Cyclic redundancy check (CRC) example.  This example demonstrates how a
    CRC can be used to validate data received through un-reliable means (e.g.
    a noisy channel).  A CRC is, in essence, a strong algebraic error
    detection code that computes a key on a block of data using base-2
    polynomials.  Also available is a checksum for data validation.

 * `cvsd_example.c`:
    Continuously-variable slope delta example, sinusoidal input. This example
    demonstrates the CVSD audio encoder interface, and its response to a
    sinusoidal input.  The output distortion ratio is computed, and the
    time-domain results are written to a file.

 * `dds_cccf_example.c`:
    Direct digital synthesizer example.  This example demonstrates
    the interface to the direct digital synthesizer.  A baseband
    pulse is generated and then efficiently up-converted
    (interpolated and mixed up) using the DDS object.  The resulting
    signal is then down-converted (mixed down and decimated) using
    the same DDS object.  Results are written to a file.

 * `eqlms_cccf_blind_example.c`:
    This example tests the least mean-squares (LMS) equalizer (EQ) on a
    signal with an unknown modulation and carrier frequency offset. That
    is, the equalization is done completely blind of the modulation
    scheme or its underlying data set. The error estimate assumes a
    constant modulus linear modulation scheme. This works surprisingly
    well even more amplitude-modulated signals, e.g. 'qam16'.

 * `eqlms_cccf_block_example.c`:
    This example tests the least mean-squares (LMS) equalizer (EQ) on a
    signal with an unknown modulation and carrier frequency offset.
    Equalization is performed blind on a block of samples and the resulting
    constellation is output to a file for plotting.

 * `eqlms_cccf_decisiondirected_example.c`:
    Tests least mean-squares (LMS) equalizer (EQ) on a signal with a known
    linear modulation scheme, but unknown data. The equalizer is updated

    user may select the FEC scheme from the command-line interface.

              `packetizer_example.c`

 * `fec_soft_example.c`:
    This example demonstrates the interface for forward error-correction
    (FEC) codes with soft-decision decoding.  A buffer of data bytes is
    encoded before the data are corrupted with at least one error and
    noise. The decoder then attempts to recover the original data set
    from the soft input bits.  The user may select the FEC scheme from
    the command-line interface.

    demonstrates the functionality of firfilt by designing a low-order 
    prototype and using it to filter a noisy signal.  The filter coefficients
    are  real, but the input and output arrays are complex. The filter order

    sequence is then decimated with the same filter, matched to the
    interpolator.

    frequency are specified at the beginning.

    with half the number of samples.  The input is a real-valued sinusoid of N
    samples. The output is a complex-valued sinusoid of N/2 samples.

    Example of the synthesis channelizer filterbank.  Random symbols are
    generated and loaded into the bins of the channelizer and the
    time-domain signal is synthesized.  Subcarriers around the band
    edges are disabled as well as those near 0.25 to demonstrate the
    synthesizer's ability to efficiently notch the spectrum. The results
    are printed to a file for plotting.

 * `flexframesync_example.c`:
    This example demonstrates the basic interface to the flexframegen and
    flexframesync objects used to completely encapsulate raw data bytes
    into frame samples (nearly) ready for over-the-air transmission. A
    14-byte header and variable length payload are encoded into baseband
    symbols using the flexframegen object.  The resulting symbols are
    interpolated using a root-Nyquist filter and the resulting samples are
    then fed into the flexframesync object which attempts to decode the
    frame. Whenever frame is found and properly decoded, its callback
    function is invoked.

    mean-squared error sense.

    Tests infinite impulse response (IIR) analog filter design. While this
    example seems purely academic as IIR filters used in liquid are all
    digital, it is important to realize that they are all derived from their
    analog counterparts. This example serves to check the response of the
    analog filters to ensure they are correct.  The results of design are
    written to a file.

    This example demonstrates the iirinterp object (IIR interpolator)
    interface.

 * `interleaver_example.c`:
    This example demonstrates the functionality of the liquid interleaver
    object.  Interleavers serve to distribute  grouped bit errors evenly
    throughout a block of data. This aids certain forward error-correction
    codes in correcting bit errors.  In this example, data bits are
    interleaved and de-interleaved; the resulting sequence is validated to
    match the original.

    cross-correlated.  The resulting correlation produces -1 for all values
    except at index zero, where the sequences align.

    and decoded.

 * `qnsearch_example.c`:

 * `quantize_example.c`:

 * `random_histogram_example.c`:
    This example tests the random number generators for different
    distributions.

    This example demonstrates the repack_bytes() interface by packing a
    sequence of three 3-bit symbols into five 2-bit symbols.  The
    results are printed to the screen.  Because the total number of bits
    in the input is 9 and not evenly divisible by 2, the last of the 5
    output symbols has a zero explicitly padded to the end.

  * `resamp2_cccf_example.c`
    This example demonstrates the halfband resampler cenetered at the
    quarter sample rate to split the signal into positive and negative
    frequency bands. Two distinct narrow-band signals are generated; one

    object is run as a filter to separate the two about the zero-
    frequency center point.

 * `resamp2_crcf_example.c`:
    This example demonstrates the halfband resampler running as both an
    interpolator and a decimator. A narrow-band signal is first

    Halfband (two-channel) filterbank example. This example demonstrates
    the analyzer/synthesizer execute() methods for the resamp2_xxxt

          of the half-band filters.

    Halfband interpolator.  This example demonstrates the interface to the

              `interp_crcf_example.c`

 * `resamp_crcf_example.c`:

 * `scramble_example.c`:
    Data-scrambling example.  Physical layer synchronization of received
    waveforms relies on independent and identically distributed underlying
    data symbols.  If the message sequence, however, is '00000....' and the
    modulation scheme is BPSK, the synchronizer probably won't be able to
    recover the symbol timing.  It is imperative to increase the entropy of
    the data for this to happen.  The data scrambler routine attempts to
    'whiten' the data sequence with a bit mask in order to achieve maximum
    entropy.  This example demonstrates the interface.

    recovery family of objects, specifically symsync_crcf. A set of random
    QPSK symbols are generated and interpolated with a timing offset. The
    resulting signal is run through the symsync_crcf object which applies a
    matched filter and recovers timing producing a clean constellation.

 * `symsync_crcf_full_example.c`:
    This example extends that of `symsync_crcf_example.c` by including options
    for simulating a timing rate offset in addition to just a timing phase
    error. The resulting output file shows not just the constellation but the
    time domain sequence as well as the timing phase estimate over time.

 * `symsync_crcf_kaiser_example.c`:
    This is a simplified example of the symync family of objects to show how
    symbol timing can be recovered after the matched filter output.

  * `symtrack_cccf_example.c`:
    
    This example demonstrates how to recover data symbols using the symtrack
    object. A stream of modulated and interpolated symbols are generated using
    the symstream object. The resulting samples are passed through a channel
    to add various impairments. The symtrack object recovers timing, carrier,
    and other information imparted by the channel and returns data symbols
    ready for demodulation.
