## OFDM frame (64 subcarriers)
##

\section{General description}
The ofdmframe64 describes a simple 802.11a-like PHY (physical layer)
implementation.  It consists of an orthogonal frequency-divisional
multiplexing (OFDM) scheme with 64 subcarriers, 12 of which are
disabled, and 4 are used as pilots.
The cyclic prefix is fixed at 16 samples.
The frame begins with a physical layer convergence procedure (PLCP)
consisting of several short sequences
(used for signal detection, and coarse frequency offset estimation)
followed by several long sequences
(used for timing acquisition, fine frequency offset estimation and
channel estimation).
The remainder of the frame consists of symbols with data stored on the
remaining 48 subcarriers.


\section{PLCP short sequences}
The PLCP short sequences consist of a single OFDM symbol with 12
subcarriers enabled.
This corresponds to four repetitions in the time domain and is used
primarily for signal detection and coarse carrier frequency offset
estimation.
The 

  Sf(f)_{-26,26} = 1/sqrt(2)*{   0, 0,
                               1+j, 0, 0, 0,
                              -1-j, 0, 0, 0,
                               1+j, 0, 0, 0,
                              -1-j, 0, 0, 0,
                              -1-j, 0, 0, 0,
                               1+j, 0, 0, 0,
                                 0, 0, 0, 0,
                              -1-j, 0, 0, 0,
                              -1-j, 0, 0, 0,
                               1+j, 0, 0, 0,
                               1+j, 0, 0, 0,
                               1+j, 0, 0, 0,
                               1+j, 0, 0 }

with the time series transformed by

  St(t) = ifft( Sf(f) ) * sqrt(64*64/12) 

The scaling factor is used to ensure that the time series has a unity
expected variance (corresponding to unity average power).

\section{PLCP long sequences}

  Lf(f)_{-26,26} = {    1, 1,
                       -1,-1, 1, 1,-1, 1,-1, 1,
                        1, 1, 1, 1, 1,-1,-1, 1,
                        1,-1, 1,-1, 1, 1, 1, 1,
                        0,
                        1,-1,-1, 1, 1,-1, 1,-1,
                        1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1, 1, 1,
                       -1,-1, 1,-1, 1,-1, 1, 1,
                        1, 1 }

with the time series transformed by

  Lt(t) = ifft( Lf(f) ) / sqrt(64*64/52)

\section{Pilot subcarriers}
Pilot subcarriers are injected into data symbols at indices -21, -7,
7, and 21.

\section{Data symbols}

\section{Synchronization Procedure}
Synchronization is performed in several steps:
    - auto-correlate the received signal (delay of 16 samples) to find
      PLCP short sequence
    - once auto-correlation magnitude exceeds threshold, estimate
      coarse CFO ( nu_hat0 = arg(rxx)/16 ) and adjust input NCO
    - estimate coarse gain and lock AGC
    - cross-correlate received signal to find both PLCP long sequences
    - once both PLCP long sequences have been found, estimate channel
      gain (invert recevied symbol with known symbol), estimate fine
      CFO ( nu_hat1 = arg( ... ) /64 ) and adjust input NCO

At this point the synchronizer is ready to receive data symbols.
The procedure for extracting data symbols is as follows:
    - buffer 80 samples (64 + 16) and run FFT on last 64
    - apply channel subcarrier gain as determined by channel
      estimation procedure via PLCP long sequences
    - Extract pilot subcarriers {-21, -7, 7, 21} and de-rotate
      accoring to pilot P/N sequence
    - Unwrap phase of pilot subcarriers and fit to first-order
      polynomial; this corresponds to fractional sample timing offset
    - de-rotate phase of all data subcarriers according to polynomial
      fit of pilot phases
    - copy all 48 data subcarriers to buffer and invoke callback
